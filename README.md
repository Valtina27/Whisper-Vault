# WHISPER VAULT

## SECURE FILE ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION PLATFORM USING RSA CRYPTOGRAPHY

## OVERVIEW

Whisper Vault is a secure web-based file encryption and decryption platform developed as a Capstone Project for the B.Sc. Artificial Intelligence and Data Science program.

The application enables users to securely upload, encrypt, decrypt, and manage confidential files using RSA asymmetric cryptography. It is designed to ensure data confidentiality while providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for secure file management.

## INSTALLATION

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Valtina27/Whisper-Vault.git
```

### Install Client Dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### Install Server Dependencies

```bash
cd ../server
npm install
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file inside both the client and server directories and configure the required environment variables.

### Start the Application

Backend

```bash
npm start
```

Frontend

```bash
npm run dev
```

## WORKFLOW

1. User registers and logs into the application.
2. User uploads a file.
3. The server encrypts the file using RSA cryptography.
4. The encrypted file is securely stored.
5. The user can decrypt the file whenever authorized.
6. Only authorized users can access protected files.

### One small suggestion

I noticed in your screenshot that your folder is named **`document`**. For a cleaner, more professional repository, I recommend renaming it to **`docs`**, since that's the standard naming convention used in most GitHub projects.

Your final structure would then look like this:

```
Whisper-Vault/
│
├── client/
├── server/
├── assets/
│   └── screenshots/
├── docs/
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
└── .gitignore
```
